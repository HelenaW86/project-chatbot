# Project Name

Project Build a Chat bot 

The project was to work in pairs and practice some parts of JavaScript that we have learnt so far by creating a chat bot that could be about whatever we wanted. 
“The problem: Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?” 
We started by watching the tutorials and reading the learning material to understand more about how we could approach the project. We started with going through the existing code that was handed to us to begin with and investigated it and its functions by using consol log. We came up with an idea for the chatbot and made a plan for the functions and the dialog it would have. By inspecting the example chatbot we started to implement various functions that we wanted to apply to our bot. We learned a lot by reading the example code and found out that some parts was effective to use for our project and some parts were not. Our focus was to create a Chatbot that used buttons, a dropdown list and a calendar. When creating the buttons and the dropdown list with different options to choose from we used the if / else statements in order to get different answers and alternatives depending on what the user selected. By learning how to store the value of a variabel we could use the selection that the user would make and collect that information to be able to display it in the bot. When created all the functions to the bot we added some styling and a background image. If we had more time we would have added more styling and made the bot more responsive for mobile view.
